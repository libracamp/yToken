# yToken
yTokens are like zero-coupon bonds: on-chain obligations that settle on a specific future date based on the price of some target asset, and are secured by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling yTokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term.

This project is an open source implementation of the ideas described in http://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf.
